FFmpeg-WHEP
================
This is a fork of the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) project that adds support for the  [WHEP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-wish-whep-02) (WebRTC-HTTP Egress Protocol) using [libdatachannel](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/libdatachannel).

## Supported Codecs
- Video: H264 / H265 / VP8 / VP9
- Audio: OPUS / PCMA / PCMU / G722

## Usage

```bash
ffplay -f whep -token <token> <whep_url>
```

## Building

1. Build **libdatachannel** by following the instructions in its [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/libdatachannel/blob/master/BUILDING.md).

2. Install **libdatachannel** to the system directory using `make install`.

3. Clone this repository and build it following the [FFmpeg Compilation Guide](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide).
Be sure to add `--enable-libdatachannel` when running the `./configure` script.

FFmpeg README
=============

FFmpeg is a collection of libraries and tools to process multimedia content
such as audio, video, subtitles and related metadata.

## Libraries

* `libavcodec` provides implementation of a wider range of codecs.
* `libavformat` implements streaming protocols, container formats and basic I/O access.
* `libavutil` includes hashers, decompressors and miscellaneous utility functions.
* `libavfilter` provides means to alter decoded audio and video through a directed graph of connected filters.
* `libavdevice` provides an abstraction to access capture and playback devices.
* `libswresample` implements audio mixing and resampling routines.
* `libswscale` implements color conversion and scaling routines.

## Tools

* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) is a command line toolbox to
  manipulate, convert and stream multimedia content.
* [ffplay](https://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html) is a minimalistic multimedia player.
* [ffprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html) is a simple analysis tool to inspect
  multimedia content.
* Additional small tools such as `aviocat`, `ismindex` and `qt-faststart`.
